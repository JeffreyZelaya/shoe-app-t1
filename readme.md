  ### HOW TO CREATE YOUR SERVER ENVIRONMENT
 
   # install dependencies. Since the pipfile already exists with the dependencies, you ONLY need to run env install
  ```
  pipenv install
  ```

   # NOTE! if you get a warning about python version being different. Go to pipfile and change python version to correct version.
    
    # EXAMPLE
    ```
    [requires]
    python_version = "3.7"
    ```
    # CHANGE TO
    ```
    [requires]
    python_version = "3.8"
    ```
  
  # enter pipenv shell
  ```
  pipenv shell
  ```

  # now you can start the server by calling the file name 'python filename.py'
  ```
  python filename.py
  ```
